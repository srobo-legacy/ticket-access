    <h2>We don't have a Media Consent Form from you!</h2>
    <p>This year we require all competitors to return a completed <a href="https://www.studentrobotics.org/resources/2012/mediaconsent.pdf">Media Consent Form</a> before they are issued with a ticket. It is vital that you have a ticket as <b>we will not be allowing entry to competitors without tickets</b>.</p>
    <p>Please hand your completed Media Consent Form to your <a href="https://www.studentrobotics.org/schools/team-leaders/">Team Leader</a>, usually your teacher, whose responsibility it is to return it to us. If you will not see your team leader before the competition, please return your completed Media Consent Form to the following address:</p>
