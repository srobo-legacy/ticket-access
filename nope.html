    <h2>We don't have a Media Consent Form from you!</h2>
    <p>We require all competitors to return a completed <a href="https://www.studentrobotics.org/mediaconsent">Media Consent Form</a> before they are issued with a ticket. It is vital that you have a ticket as <b>we will not be allowing entry to competitors without tickets</b>.</p>
    <p>Please hand your completed Media Consent Form to your Team Leader, usually your teacher, who will sort out returning it to us. If you have already handed your completed Media Consent Form to your Team Leader please speak to them to check that they've forwarded it on to us. Bear in mind that it may take us up to two days to process any returned Media Consent Forms.</p>
    <p>Your Team Leader should contact your Local Team Coordinator if they require assistance.</p>
